Rad's previous experience

After a frustrating time, Rad realized the mistake: the scale of the view was all wrong: the default size for the view assumed a far smaller scale than the huge lidar model of the chasm. The software had issued scale mismatch warnings, Rad had dismissed them. It was necessary to learn what they meant.

Rad had always been time-centric, but now appreciated the nuances of representing 3D space in a computer program.

Zoom… out. Dolly… out. Zoom… all the way out. Not that far. Dolly in. Ok.

3DSee had set the ground plane of Rad’s virtual perspective to coincide with at the deepest point measured by the drone, as if the viewer were buried deep beneath the cliff wall ringing the structure.

A casual viewer, that is, able to see through solid rock. Rad was viewing the outer wall of the cenote from a point of view ten meters outside it. The wall appeared as a translucent curtain of green separating Rad from the interior of the Pool of Xblanque.

Rad rolled the view forward to stand just inside the curtain. The view was still too low: the deepest point in the model was deeper than the local floor. Rad scrolled the view straight upwards, 30 meters, so the point of view was no longer within solid rock, and widened the angle of view.

Rad was standing on the steep edge of a beach made of limestone slabs, a scree slope of breakdown blocks descending sharply down to a pool of water of indefinite depth, a surface showing nothing but a reflection of the whitish fog bank above. Across the water, in the distance magnified by the volumetric lighting of the simulation, irregular islands of massive tumble-down slabs stretched into mutual obscurity with the fog.

Rad blanked the screen, and reached for the rucksack beneath the table. There were a pair of 3D gaming goggles in there.

A slurp of cold coffee brought Rad back to…. Coffee shop. Civilians. Old people. Several comparing the clocks on their medical monitors to the time displayed on their device screens. In a bewildered and agitated fashion that Rad knew. What time was it? It was probably not a good idea to ask. How long had Rad been here? It was hard to say.

Rad thought fast. You are not under the Yucatan. You are in (Rad checked the local weather app) Louisville, Kentucky.

At that moment a glorious and life altering thought struck Rad. This changed everything. The VR goggles weren’t in the rucksack. They were on the charger. In the van. The van, away from all these people. Rad was halfway to the van before another thought struck. The coffee. It was cold but still mostly full.

Where was it? Where it must have been. 

As Rad burst back through the door, the proprietor of Hofer’s Java looked up from conversation with an elderly coffee patron, and gave Rad a pleasant and welcoming smile as Rad dashed back in for the precious liquid. Odd for it to be welcoming because Rad had sat in there for six hours. The goggles.
