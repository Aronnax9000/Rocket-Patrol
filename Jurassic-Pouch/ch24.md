# The Marcel Loubens

To the untrained eye, the ship looked innocent enough, tied up at Merida Quay. The ship was built for the Intracoastal Waterway, not for the open sea. 32 meters long, with a shallow draft and twin electric engines. Though some fifty years old, the boat was obviously well loved, and its name, painted proudly across the stern, was the Marcel Loubens.

After thanking the Perera-Pazes for their hospitality, the Rocket Ranchers drove into town. The rental car was good, but, behind the wheel, Merl wasn't alone in already missing the Yucatan Railway.

Bobbie bit down on the regulator, pitched backwards off the starboard gunwale of the Marcel Loubens, and plunged into the water. 

Terry followed a couple of seconds later. The Gulf water was warm. The two made their way downward along the dive line until they reached its anchor in the seabed. A second line paid out from the first, laid along the sea floor. Brightly colored plastic marker arrows, tied to the dive line every few feet, indicated the way "out", back to the anchor and the boat.
