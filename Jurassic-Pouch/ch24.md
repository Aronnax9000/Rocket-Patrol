# The *Marcel Loubens*

After thanking the Perera-Pazes for their hospitality, the Rocket Ranchers took the tram down the hillside and into Merida. Merl was "driving", but the tram was on autopilot mode. They would all miss the Yucatan Railway. The tram's regenerative braking indicator winked red as the tram descended. MaryLiz remembered her alarm in seeing it for the first time. *It can be scary until you know....* Mx Perera-Paz had said. Now the blinking light was a comfort, a reminder that all was well for the tram's automated return journey. 

At the bottom of the hill, the tram shunted into a parking space, and the travelers transfered their gear to a waiting taxi. Soon the band arrived at Merida Quay, slip 42.

To the untrained eye, the ship looked truly old, from the age of sail. 32 meters long, with a shallow draft and twin electric engines. Though some fifty years old, the boat was obviously well loved, and its name, painted proudly across the wooden planks of the stern, was the *Marcel Loubens*. Furled to the masts, its sails shimmered a metallic blue green in the sunlight. 

Merl gave a low whistle. "The sails are solar panels." 

"Indeed, they are, and the batteries are full!" It was Petra, captain of the *Marcel Loubens*. "Step on up, so I can welcome you aboard!" 

This done, there were introductions all around. 

Bobbie bit down on the regulator, pitched backwards off the starboard gunwale of the Marcel Loubens, and plunged into the water. 

Terry followed a couple of seconds later. The Gulf water was warm. The two made their way downward along the dive line until they reached its anchor in the seabed. A second line paid out from the first, laid along the sea floor. Brightly colored plastic marker arrows, tied to the dive line every few feet, indicated the way "out", back to the anchor and the boat.
