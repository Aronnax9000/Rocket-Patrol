# The *Marcel Loubens*

After thanking the Perera-Pazes for their hospitality, the Rocket Ranchers took the tram down the hillside and into Merida. Merl was "driving", but the tram was on autopilot mode, as there were too many passengers for the Perera-Pazes to accompany them. They would all miss the Yucatan Railway. The tram's regenerative braking indicator winked red as the tram descended. MaryLiz remembered her alarm in seeing it for the first time. *It can be scary until you know....* Mx Perera-Paz had said. Now the blinking light was a comfort, a reminder that all was well for the tram's automated return journey. 

At the bottom of the hill, the tram shunted into a parking space, and the travelers transfered their gear to a waiting taxi. Soon the band arrived at Merida Quay, slip 42.

The ship was a single masted sailing vessel. To Merl's eyes, the boat was not new, but obviously well loved. Its name, painted proudly across the wooden planks of the stern, was the *Marcel Loubens*. Furled to the mainmast, its sails shimmered a metallic blue green in the sunlight. 

Merl gave a low whistle. "That's 'e-fabric'. The sails are solar panels." 

"And our ballast is all battery, and the batteries are full!" It was Petra, captain of the *Marcel Loubens*, calling from the boat's railing. "Step on up, so I can welcome you aboard!" 

This done, there were introductions all around. Lukas, the deckhand, who was hard of hearing. "Professor emeritus of Maritime Architecture", whispered Petra. "The University doesn't have the heart to tell the poor Professor that they've reached mandatory retirement age, so they keep granting sabattical years."

The Professor seemed one of the oldest working professionals MaryLiz had encountered in years, but perhaps the weathered skin and grey hair came with life aboard ship. "How long has Lukas been with you?"

"Three or four seasons... you know, I'm not quite sure, and I'm willing to bet the Prof's forgotton too."

MaryLiz laughed, "Maybe it's best that you keep it that way."

Using a crane, the crew of the *Marcel Loubens* lowered *Le Garage* into the water off the starboard side.  

The two divers were ready. Bobbie bit down on the breathing regulator, pitched backwards off the starboard gunwale of the Marcel Loubens, and plunged into the water. Terry followed suit. The two bobbed to the surface, and swam a couple of meters to *Le Garage*. The two divers placed hands on the floating submersible to steady themselves.

Aboard the boat, Petra untied the spring line from its kevil and tossed the end to Bobbie, who caught the rope before it hit the water. Bobbie clipped the end of the line to a dive belt karabiner, while Terry removed the shackle which still secured *Le Garage* to the sailboat's crane hoist. This done, the two divers and the submersible were now on their own.

Petra called out from the deck. "Everything looks good here, just bleed off the BC when you're ready." Bobbie gave a thumbs up and opened a valve on the air-filled buoyancy compensator, a bright yellow bag mounted on top of *Le Garage*, and massaged the bag to help it deflate. Soon the divers, and their strange contraption, disappeared below the surface, in a cloud of bubbles.

"Now what?" asked Merl. 

"Now," said the Captain, "we wait to see if they come back."

The Gulf water was warm. The two made their way downward along the dive line until they reached its anchor in the seabed. A second line paid out from the first, laid along the sea floor. Brightly colored plastic marker arrows, tied to the dive line every few feet, indicated the way "out", back to the anchor and the boat.
