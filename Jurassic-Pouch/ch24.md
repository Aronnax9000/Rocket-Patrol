# The *Marcel Loubens*

After thanking the Perera-Pazes for their hospitality, the Rocket Ranchers took the tram down the hillside and into Merida. Merl was "driving", but the tram was on autopilot mode. They would all miss the Yucatan Railway. The tram's regenerative braking indicator winked red as the tram descended. MaryLiz remembered her alarm in seeing it for the first time. *It can be scary until you know....* Mx Perera-Paz had said. Now the blinking light was a comfort, a reminder that all was well for the tram's automated return journey. 

At the bottom of the hill, the tram shunted into a parking space, and the travelers transfered their gear to a waiting taxi. Soon the band arrived at Merida Quay, slip 42.

The ship was a single masted sailing vessel. To Merl's eyes, the boat was not new, but obviously well loved. Its name, painted proudly across the wooden planks of the stern, was the *Marcel Loubens*. Furled to the mainmast, its sails shimmered a metallic blue green in the sunlight. 

Merl gave a low whistle. "The sails are solar panels." 

"Indeed, they are, and the batteries are full!" It was Petra, captain of the *Marcel Loubens*, calling from the boat's railing. "Step on up, so I can welcome you aboard!" 

This done, there were introductions all around.

Using a crane, the crew of the *Marcel Loubens* lowered *Le Garage* into the water off the starboard side.  

The two divers were ready. Bobbie bit down on the breathing regulator, pitched backwards off the starboard gunwale of the Marcel Loubens, and plunged into the water. Terry followed suit. The two bobbed to the surface, and swam a couple of meters to *Le Garage*. The two divers placed hands on the floating submersible to steady themselves.

Aboard the boat, Petra untied the spring line from its kevil and tossed the end to Bobbie, who caught the rope before it hit the water. Bobbie clipped the end of the line to a karabiner on zer dive belt, while Terry removed the shackle holding *Le Garage* to the sailboat's crane hoist.

Terry followed a couple of seconds later. The Gulf water was warm. The two made their way downward along the dive line until they reached its anchor in the seabed. A second line paid out from the first, laid along the sea floor. Brightly colored plastic marker arrows, tied to the dive line every few feet, indicated the way "out", back to the anchor and the boat.
