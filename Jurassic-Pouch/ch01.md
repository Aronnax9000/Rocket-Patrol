# Chapter One: A Visitor from the Sky

## Melbourne, Australia

The rocket shuttle lifted into the air.

The acceleration was too great for Jo to look to the side in comfort. A screen showed the aft camera view: a fiery plume of incandescent exhaust streaming into the camera's vanishing point.

The rocket gained altitude, slowly, through the thickest part of Earth's atmosphere. Jo spotted the coast of Melbourne, perched on the shore of the blue waters of the Bass Strait. The rocket rolled slightly. King Island, the Tasmanian coast, and there was Flinders Island.

The rocket’s acceleration slackened slightly as the main engines throttled back. Another chime sounded. A voice announcement: "Max Q." Seconds later, with no announcement, the rocket's acceleration reintensified.

After six minutes or so, the main engine cut out, and with a mild bang, the lifting stage separated from the shuttle and drifted away after a brief maneuver of its own. A chime sounded, and the voice of the spacecraft intoned, "Microgravity. Re-entry in three minutes." 

Now, real shutters opened over real glass windows. The sun was fading fast to the West, even though Jo had launched at noon. For a moment, Jo could see a face partially reflected in the window. It was Jo's own face.

Jo looked past the reflection. The Southern Pacific Ocean. There wasn’t much to see. But that fact was itself remarkable. From this viewpoint, the Earth was an ocean planet, speckled here and there with tiny islands only visible while exaggerated in the projected geographical overlay. What was this spot called? The antipode? That wasn't it. Every place on earth has an antipode. _But I'm not on earth._

Another chime. "Prepare for gravity. Entry, Descent, and Landing." The window shutter whirred shut, and the shuttle changed its orientation. The passenger compartment gimballed in sync with the ship’s rotation to keep Jo’s back to the direction of deceleration. 

The main display showed the horizon, a crosshair indicating the point towards which the shuttle was hurtling. What Jo thought to be first sight of land turned out to just be the haze of the thicker part of the atmosphere, seen edge-on. A storm front off the coast of Chile. Jo strained to catch sight of the Americas. There! (The computer locked focus.) North America?

Baja. Now North America proper. The computer locked radar, and a cold jet fired. The view turned southward by a degree, and Baja scrolled out of view to the left. The EDL clock read -12:48. Thirteen minutes to go.

Jo’s stomach growled. Texas food had better be good.

## Boca Chica, Texas

Fusion the Horse carried Captain MaryLiz Bender southward, over a grassland north of the Rio Grande. The astronaut's head was inclined to the sky: the horse's head was daydreaming. 

Of _Oats._

A sonic boom startled Fusion from the reverie. The horse looked up, blinked, and snorted.

In the sky above South Padre Island, a silver form was descending from the southwest, the upper stage of a passenger rocket shuttle. Its stainless steel fusilage glinted in the late afternoon Texas sun. The shuttle was in full belly flop, its long axis parallel to the ground, as it slowed its plunge through the steadily thickening atmosphere.

Captain MaryLiz Bender flipped the reins. “Come on, Fusion, let’s go to the house!”

“The house” meant the stable. Fusion knew that there was an extra bag of oats in the stable, because today was Saturday, when the Rocket People came to help out in the paddock. The Rocket People always brought an extra bag. An extra bag of _oats_.

_Oats._

Fusion could see the shuttle falling, too, nearing the horizon under the clear blue Texas sky. 

_An extra bag of oats. In. the. stable._ Fusion lit for home.

Horse and human arrived at the paddock gate just as the shuttle pitched tail-downwards, relit its primary drive, and landed.

The oats were good. Fusion licked the bottom of the extra bag clean, grateful to the Rocket People's inability to count without the help of second order partial differential equations.

MaryLiz opened the gate to the farrier stall and knocked on the cedar gatepost. 
 
Frances, the ranch’s large animal veterinarian, was installing a new power outlet.

“Hey Frances, Jo just landed.”

“I heard the boom. I hope their work Visa works out, it's a long flight back to Australia."

“It used to be. Um, Frances, you said I could borrow the Camry? To pick up Jo?”

“I did say that you could borrow my Camry.”

“Come on, Jo’s from out of town. You’ll like ‘em. Keys, please.”

“Use the tarp in the trunk when you load all the gear.”

“I will. Keys?”

“They're under the seat.”

“Thanks!” MaryLiz opened the gate and headed for the driveway. 

Frances shouted after Bender. “Hey, Cap, I forgot to tell you. We’re down three bags of oats!”

...

Boca Chica Spaceport was lavish for the community it served. Built as a plaything of a vanished generation of rocket entrepreneurs, its short General Aviation runway was only active during the morning and evening, ferrying commuters and tourists from San Antonio, Houston, and El Paso. Rocket shuttles were few. At this hour, the Arrivals parking lot was completely empty. MaryLiz parked the Camry, and sliding glass doors, dusty on the outside, allowed her entry to the terminal.

Bender chuckled inwardly. _I should have printed a placard to hold up at the gate: PROF JO STAPLEDON._ 

And then, there was Jo, already debarked and walking towards MaryLiz, with a smile of recognition.

Which meant Jo had been waved through United States Customs in no more than five minutes. Odd.

“Dr Stapledon! I'm MaryLiz!" The two clasped hands.

“Please, call me Jo, I’m not long on ceremony.” Stapledon’s Australian accent sounded wonderful. MaryLiz wondered how her own partly affected Texas twang sounded to Aussie ears.

“OK, Jo. Great, thank you so much for coming. Let's hit Baggage Claim and head to the Ranch."

The scientist and the astronaut loaded up a robot autocart with the considerable pile of cargo that had accompanied Jo through the upper atmosphere. The sliding doors opened to the Texas air. Jo breathed in salted air and a faint bouquet of petrochemicals.

The autocart followed Jo and MaryLiz through the parking lot with an occasional beeping peace-cry. The sun was sunk low in the western sky. "I left Melbourne at noon...." said Jo.

MaryLiz was no stranger to 'rocket lag'. "Are you hungry?"

Jo was direct. “It was getting towards midnight when I left Melbourne. They told me not to eat before I flew, and I couldn’t spare the launch mass of a sandwich.”

“OK, Food options. There’s SustainaMart, in Sustainaville, on South Padre. But If you can hold out fifteen minutes till we get to the ranch, a welcome feast awaits.”

“Sounds good -- but if you've set a menu in my honor, I don't care much for fresh Wallaby, despite my specialization.”

“Wouldn’t dream of it. We're synthevores at the Ranch, mostly. Lab cultured all the way. On top of that, one ‘fresh’ we do have is ‘out of Wallaby’.”

"I'm sure I'll enjoy it." Jo fell silent: the scientist was looking out the window at the scrubby grassland scrolling by.

There was no good way to broach the subject. “Any thoughts so far on our ‘situation’?” MaryLiz raised her index fingers from the steering wheel to make air quotes around the word.

“After dinner talk. I want to see Frances' presentation first, although the redacted report certainly got my attention.”

“Yes, of course.” MaryLiz glanced towards the back seat of the car. “You’re packing some fancy kit. Medical placard, bio-seal, active cryo. Someone’s taking our little discovery seriously.”

“Yes, all that and a bag of crisps.”

“The active cryo, I hadn’t seen one of the newer ones. They let you keep it running while it was in flight?"

Jo’s poker face cracked for a split second. “UNESCO priority payload. They gave me all I asked for, and a bit more for rainy days. I was surprised at the snappy response: your site isn't on the World Heritage Site list....”

"Thank goodness for small mysteries," said MaryLiz. "I'm anxious to see if you can help us solve ours."

Jo glanced at the center dashboard of the vintage economy car.

“Hey, do you actually have cassette tapes for this thing?”
