# Chapter Twenty: 2029: The Cloister Cluster

Sister Louis had a problem.

Something or someone was introducing peak loads on the server during off hours. Three GPUs in the Cluster had yielded up their magic smoke in the past month, their fragrance lingering in the server room buried deep beneath the Abbey.

Only the older sisters were awake at such hours, taking advantage of the idle processing power to play Taiko 23, but even at maximum resolution and framerate, these simple 3D games scarcely tickled the noise floor of the performance graph.

The offending process was called "initiative" (all lowercase) and ran headless, conducting all its business via network connections. 

Network connections. From where? Louis arped and greped. From the Abbey of Gethemane, six miles away.

Sister Louis was babysitter to both the Abbot's children and their collection of antique game consoles, so it was easiest to just send a text.
