Brother, can you check on a remote process called "initiative"? It has retro server privs, and it's not playing nice. Three smoked out GPUs, all three previously working museum pieces.

Sister, that process is remote to us too, from some cloud control node in our crowd computing service. I have emailed the Archsysadmin in Louisville for more info. It must be an old process, since it requested ancient computer hardware. No one writes fresh code for your antiques anymore. My guess is that someone fat fingered the year in a job scheduler twenty years ago, on a server that should have been unplugged 10 years ago. Wonder if that person is still even alive?
