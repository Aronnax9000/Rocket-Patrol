Brother, can you check on a remote process called "initiative"? It has retro server privs, and it's not playing nice. Three smoked out GPUs, all three previously working museum pieces.

Sister, that process is remote to us too, from some cloud control node in our crowd computing service. I have emailed the Archsysadmin in Louisville for more info. It must be an old process, since it requested ancient computer hardware. No one writes fresh code for your antiques anymore. My guess is that someone fat fingered the year in a job scheduler twenty years ago, on a server that should have been unplugged 10 years ago. Wonder if that person is still even alive?

Sorry about your toasted hardware. I understand that replacements are rare, but if you do find some, I am sure the Diocese can smash a piggy bank to make you whole. Just remind Thester Kat at the Diocese that I said it's all my fault.

Sister Sparks paged through the online auction listings. Antique GPUs. Sparks filtered by interface and architecture, and made a few notes in pencil on a fresh piece of stationery. She'd need to run the narrowed list past the Gamer Sisters, especially with Old Nuns Only less than a week away.
