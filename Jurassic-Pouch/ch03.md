# Chapter Three: Rad

A hollow voice said, "What fresh Hell is this?"

Rad's phone was ringing on the hotel nightstand. Rad rolled over and picked it up. 'BENDY calling'. Rad thumbed 'Answer'. 

“Bendy!” said Rad, when MaryLiz appeared on the screen. “What planet are you even on? At this hour?”

“That's 'Captain Bendy' to you! Same planet as you, I hope,” said the astronaut. It was their special ritual greeting. “I’m home, on the Rocket Ranch.”

“Deep in the Heart of Texas?”

“The very same! How are you, friend?”

“Living my dream, or someone else’s. I’m in Kansas City... not sure which one. What time is it there?”

“I’m in Texas, silly, it’s after three in the morning, same as you, no matter which Kansas City you’re in.”

“3:42 AM. Lovely. Should we sync our watches?” said Rad.

“Knowing you, we already have.[^1] Rad, we have ourselves a real puzzle down here on the Ranch. Something you might like to take a look at. There's time code involved, so I thought of you.”

“My brain is open. Go on.”

“We are keeping the actual details quiet, but, consider this hypothetical. Say you're in a coffee shop, and one by one, everyone’s devices are stolen and dragged out of wireless range. Could you examine a record of what those devices were transmiting, up to the moment they disappeared, and figure out when and where they went?”

“Easily, if I was the one who took them. But seriously? Maybe, at least the 'when' part. Do I have access to the wireless router? I'd want to look at the activity logs.”

“That’s the problem. We don’t have any. Our router was a simple minded radio repeater, and wasn’t set up to log metadata. In hindsight, of course, I wish we had thought ahead.”

“I bet Frances bought it from a thrift store in Houston. What were the missing devices doing when they were stolen?”

“Sending livestreams. Video with sound. Ten wildlife cameras, all going at once. We recorded everything we received, up to the moments when each of them vanished. All tagged with time code, accurate to a second or so."

"How good were the signals, when everything was working?"

“Acceptable, until things went haywire at the end. There’s little dropouts here and there, where we miss brief moments from one camera or another.”

“That actually might be useful. Send me the streams. I'll want a map showing each camera's location, relative to the repeater if we have it.”

“I'm sure Frances will be happy to do that." MaryLiz appreciated Rad's use of 'we'. Rad was obviously already thinking about a solution. "One final thing, what you are going to see is eyes-only stuff for now."

"I understood you the first time. I'll keep it to myself."

"You’re golden, Rad.”

“Platinum-Iridium standard. Takes one to know one, Bendy.”

[^1]: Rad was a Time Zone Abolitionist, preferring to use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Software written to Rad’s own specifications ran 24/7, on every device Rad owned, hurling time synchronization signals into the aether to any device in range that wanted the time of day. Rad configured the time server to serve Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) time exclusively, no matter what the requested timezone offset. This rendered some older citizens’ devices unusable, and Rad had picked up coffee money by helping such citizens set their devices to keep UTC natively. “You just have to remember the local offset wherever you are, and subtract the difference in your head.” This behavior resulted in Rad being banned from every coffee shop in town. Rad took the ban as divine inspiration, left town. Now Rad roamed the country in an electric caravan, broadcasting time synchronization signals wherever they might be “needed”.
