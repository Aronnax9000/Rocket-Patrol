# Chapter Three: Rad

Rad's phone rang on the hotel nightstand. Rad picked it up. MaryLiz Bender calling. Rad thumbed "Answer". 

“Bendy!” said Rad, when MaryLiz appeared on the screen. “What planet are you even on?”

“That's 'Captain Bendy' to you! Same planet as you, I hope,” said the astronaut. Their ritual greeting.

“I’m down in Texas.”

“Deep in the heart of?”

“The very same! How are you, old friend?”

“I’m living the dream. Or maybe someone else’s. I’m in Kansas City, I’m not even sure which one! What time is it there?”

“I’m in Texas, silly, it’s after three in the morning, same as you, no matter what Kansas City you’re in.”

“3:42 AM. Lovely. Should we sync our watches?” said Rad. MaryLiz could hear music playing in the background.

“Knowing you, we already have.[^1] Rad, we have a real puzzle down on the Ranch. Something I think you might enjoy taking a look at.”

“My brain is open.”

“We're keeping the details quiet, but, just as a hypothetical, say you were in a coffee shop, and one by one, everyone’s devices were stolen and dragged out of wifi range. Could you figure out when, and where they went?”

“Easily, if I was the one who took them. But seriously? Maybe, at least the time part. I'd want to look at the router logs.”

“That’s the problem. We don’t have any. The router wasn’t set up to log anything. I wish we had thought ahead.”

Rad could tell that Bendy was serious. “I bet Frances bought it from a thrift store in Houston. What were the stolen devices doing when they went missing?”

“Sending livestreams. Video with sound. Ten cameras’ worth, all going at once. We recorded everything, up to the moments each of them vanished."

“Well, yes. At least, we didn’t compress what we received any more than the cameras may have on their own, prior to transmission. We do have the raw streams, glitches and all. The video is pretty good but there’s little dropouts here and there where we miss a few frames.”

“That actually might be useful. Send me what you have. I'll want a map showing each camera's location, relative to the repeater if we have it.”

“I'm sure Frances will be happy to do that. You’re golden, Rad.”

“Platinum-Iridium standard. Takes one to know one, Bendy.”

[^1]: Rad was a Time Zone Abolitionist, preferring to use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Software written to Rad’s own specifications ran 24/7, on every device Rad owned, hurling time synchronization signals into the aether to any device in range that wanted the time of day. Rad configured the time server to serve Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) time exclusively, no matter what the requested timezone offset. This rendered some older citizens’ devices unusable, and Rad had picked up coffee money by helping such citizens set their devices to keep UTC natively. “You just have to remember the local offset wherever you are, and subtract the difference in your head.” This behavior resulted in Rad being banned from every coffee shop in town. Rad took the ban as divine inspiration, left town. Now Rad roamed the country in an electric caravan, broadcasting time synchronization signals wherever they might be “needed”.
