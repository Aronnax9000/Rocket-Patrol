# Chapter Three: Rad

On the hotel nightstand, Rad's phone rang. Rad rolled over in bed and picked it up. MaryLiz Bender calling. Rad thumbed "Answer". 

“Bendy!” said Rad, when MaryLiz appeared on the screen. “What planet are you even on?”

“That's 'Captain Bendy' to you! Same planet as you, I hope,” said the astronaut. This was their special ritual greeting. “I’m home, in Texas.”

“Deep in the Heart of Texas Texas?”

“The very same! How are you, friend?”

“Living my dream, or someone else’s. I’m in Kansas City... not sure which one. What time is it there?”

“I’m in Texas, silly, it’s after three in the morning, same as you, no matter which Kansas City you’re in.”

“3:42 AM. Lovely. Should we sync our watches?” said Rad. MaryLiz could hear music playing in the background.

“Knowing you, we already have.[^1] Rad, we have ourselves a real puzzle down here on the Ranch. Something you might like a look at. There's time code involved, so I thought of you.”

“My brain is open. Go on.”

“We're keeping the details quiet, but, just as a hypothetical, say you were in a coffee shop, and one by one, everyone’s devices were stolen and dragged out of wifi range. Could you figure out when, and where they went?”

“Easily, if I was the one who took them. But seriously? Maybe, at least the time part. I'd want to look at the logs.”

“That’s the problem. We don’t have any. The repeater wasn’t set up to log metadata. I wish we had thought ahead.”

“I bet Frances bought it from a thrift store in Houston. What were the stolen devices doing when they went missing?”

“Sending livestreams. Video with sound. Ten cameras’ worth, all going at once. We recorded everything we received, up to the moments each of them vanished, with timecode."

"How good is the video?"

“Acceptable, until things go haywire at the end, but there’s little dropouts here and there where we miss a few frames.”

“That actually might be useful. Send me the streams. I'll want a map showing each camera's location, relative to the repeater if we have it.”

MaryLiz appreciated the use of 'we'. Rad was obviously already thinking about a solution. “I'm sure Frances will be happy to do that. One final thing, what you are going to see is eyes-only stuff for now."

"Understood. I'll keep it to myself."

"You’re golden, Rad.”

“Platinum-Iridium standard. Takes one to know one, Bendy.”

[^1]: Rad was a Time Zone Abolitionist, preferring to use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Software written to Rad’s own specifications ran 24/7, on every device Rad owned, hurling time synchronization signals into the aether to any device in range that wanted the time of day. Rad configured the time server to serve Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) time exclusively, no matter what the requested timezone offset. This rendered some older citizens’ devices unusable, and Rad had picked up coffee money by helping such citizens set their devices to keep UTC natively. “You just have to remember the local offset wherever you are, and subtract the difference in your head.” This behavior resulted in Rad being banned from every coffee shop in town. Rad took the ban as divine inspiration, left town. Now Rad roamed the country in an electric caravan, broadcasting time synchronization signals wherever they might be “needed”.
