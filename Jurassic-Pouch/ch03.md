# Chapter Three: Rad

## Kansas City

From the hotel nightstand a hollow voice said, "What fresh Hell is this?"

It was Rad's ringtone for friends. Rad rolled over and picked it the phone. The screen glowed. 'BENDY calling'. Rad thumbed 'Answer'. 

“Bendy!” said Rad, when MaryLiz appeared on the screen. “What planet are you even on? At this hour?”

“That's 'Captain Bendy' to you! Same planet as you, I hope,” said the astronaut. It was their special ritual greeting. “I’m home, on the Rocket Ranch.”

“Texas?”

“Deep in the Heart of! How are you, friend?”

“Living my dream, or someone else’s. I’m in Kansas City... not sure which one. What time is it there?”

“I’m in Texas, silly, it’s after three in the morning, same as you, no matter which Kansas City you’re in.”

“3:42 AM. Lovely. Should we sync our watches?” said Rad.

“Knowing you, we already have.[^1] Rad, we have ourselves a real puzzle down here on the Ranch. Something you might like to take a look at. There's time code involved, and I thought of you, right away.”

“My brain is open. Go on.”

“We are keeping the details quiet, but, consider a hypothetical. Umm... say you're in a coffee shop, and one by one, everyone’s devices are dragged out of wireless range by an unseen thief. Also, you have a complete record of what those devices were transmiting, up to when they disappeared. Could you figure out when and where they went?”

“Easily, if I was the thief. But seriously? Maybe, at least the 'when' part. Do I have access to the wireless router? I'd want to look at the activity logs.”

“That’s the problem. We don’t have any. Our router was a simple minded radio repeater. It wasn’t set up to log anything. In hindsight, of course, I wish we'd thought ahead.”

“Frances bought it from a thrift store in Houston, I bet. What were the missing devices doing when they were stolen?”

“Sending livestreams. Video with sound." There was a pause as MaryLiz collected her thoughts. "Again, we're keeping quiet on the details, but it was wildlife cameras. Ten of them. All going at once. We recorded everything we received. All tagged with time code, accurate to a second or so."

"How good were the streams, when everything was working?"

“Acceptable, until things went haywire at the end. But there are little blank patches in the video, here and there, where we miss brief moments from one camera or another.”

Now it was Rad's turn to be serious. “Those missing frames are signal data in disguise. Send me the streams. I'll want a map showing each camera's location, relative to the repeater if we have it.”

“I'm sure Frances will be happy to do that." MaryLiz appreciated Rad's use of 'we'. Rad was obviously already thinking about a solution. "One final thing, what you are going to see is eyes-only stuff for now."

"I understood you the first time. I'll keep it to myself."

"You’re golden, Rad.”

“I'm the Platinum-Iridium Standard, Bendy! And it takes one to know one.”

[^1]: Rad was a Time Zone Abolitionist, preferring to use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Software written to Rad’s own specifications ran 24/7, on every device Rad owned, hurling time synchronization signals into the aether to any device in range that wanted the time of day. Rad configured the time server to serve Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) time exclusively, no matter what the requested timezone offset. This rendered some older citizens’ devices unusable, and Rad had picked up coffee money by helping such citizens set their devices to keep UTC natively. “You just have to remember the local offset wherever you are, and subtract the difference in your head.” This behavior resulted in Rad being banned from every coffee shop in town. Rad took the ban as divine inspiration, left town. Now Rad roamed the country in an electric caravan, broadcasting time synchronization signals wherever they might be “needed”.
