# Dramatis Personae (in order of appearance)

## Jo Stapledon ''(Homo sapiens sp.)'', Ph. D. 

Australia's most celebrated marsupial scientist, with a specialization in Kangaroo and allied species.

## Fusion the Horse ''(Artyriodactlus)''

A Horse. Highly food motivated, like Gurgi in the Book of Three. Cunning and inventive, but it's all about getting those oats. Also based on the horse and dog Top from the Jules Verne novel Invasion of the Sea. 

## Captain MaryLiz ("Cap") Bender

The Nancy Drew of the piece. Trained as an astronaut, Bender settled near Boca Chica spaceport for its cheap ballistic passenger flights to Kennedy Space Center, where she is often called upon to command missions into outer space. But everyone needs a hobby, so Bender purchased a dilapidated dude ranch and made it her own.

## Frances Wannamaker, D. V. M. 

The Rocket Ranch's large animal veterinarian, and part time electrician.

An animal lover from birth, in their teenage years, Francis volunteered at an animal shelter before persuing a degree (never completed) in Electrical Engineering. 

Based on the real life ethologist Temple Grandin, the fictional character of Dr. Marian Lazarus in the excellent 1981 film Outland (who is in turn probably based on the corresponding character in High Noon), and Fran Blanche of FranLab (Philadelphia).
