# _Dramatis Personae_ 

_(in order of appearance)_

## Jo Stapledon, Ph. D. 

Australia's most celebrated marsupial scientist, with a specialization in Kangaroo and allied species.

## Fusion the Horse (Dickin Medal)

Horse. Highly food motivated. Cunning and inventive, helpful when necessary, but it's all about getting those oats. Fusion considers themself as Chaotic Good and is frustrated that they only manage to come off as Lawful Good to the humans around them.

The food motivation and overall affability is down to Gurgi in the Book of Three. Also based on the horse and dog Top from the Jules Verne novel Invasion of the Sea. 

## Captain MaryLiz ("Cap") Bender

The Nancy Drew of the piece. Trained as an astronaut, Bender settled near Boca Chica spaceport for its cheap ballistic passenger flights to Kennedy Space Center, where she is often called upon to command missions into outer space. But everyone needs a hobby, so Bender purchased a dilapidated dude ranch and made it her own.

## Frances Wannamaker, D. V. M. 

The Rocket Ranch's large animal veterinarian, and part time electrician.

An animal lover from birth, in their teenage years, Francis volunteered at an animal shelter before persuing a degree (never completed) in Electrical Engineering. 

Based on the real life ethologist Temple Grandin, the fictional character of Dr. Marian Lazarus in the excellent 1981 film Outland (who is in turn probably based on the corresponding character in High Noon), Fran Blanche of FranLab (Philadelphia). The Doctor McCoy of the piece.

Frances could care less, these days, about electrical engineering, preferring to manage the Ranch's horses and other animals, but refuses to allow any licensed contractor onto the Rocket Ranch, because Frances has the Rocket Ranch wired and networked according to specific needs of the entire team, and any outside contractor would only screw it up. Chews a strand of 14 gauge PVC wire insulation instead of a piece of straw.

## Merl

The chief ranch hand, effectively Bender's first officer, but day to day reports to Frances since Bender is in space so often. Not a Surfer, Merl's car broke down outside the ranch during a cross country vision quest, and Merl took it as a sign to stay. Once capped a leaking undersea oil well using nukes, but none of the other characters know that. Based in part on Clancy Brown's portrayal of  Rawhide in "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai: Across the Eighth Dimension (1984). Merl isn't afraid to ask a simple question that more often than not gets the academics of the team (i.e., almost everybody else) out of a rut and into orthogonal thinking. Like the Hong Kong Cavaliers, Merl's true identity is shrouded in mystery, mostly because it never occurs to anyone to ask.

## Varley and Cass

Ex students of Frances' from the latter's days as a professor at Texas A&M. Varley is post-doc, and Cass is a graduate student, but Varley is an ethologist, and Cass's skills in genome analysis and population genetics mean that Varley is happy to sit at Cass's feet for the duration, as Feynman did when he apprenticed himself to biologists. A bit older than Cass, Varley can be overprotective of Cass, as a junior colleague, and bends over backwards to ensure that Cass retains academic priority for any discovery they make together (Hoyle and Burnell).
