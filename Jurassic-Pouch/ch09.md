# Chapter Nine: In the Wind

The Clarke Bar was hopping tonight. High tide seemed to bring out high times in the more oceancentric residents of Sustainaville, and the Clarke’s excellent online reviews ensured a steady stream of both coastal tourists and visiting aerospace workers in addition to its many regulars.

Merl ordered the usual and propped both boots onto the bar’s foot rail.

The last thing Merl remembered going on at the ranch was MaryLiz throwing a weary glance in Merl’s direction.

She’d been on the phone with some hurricane modeling bigwigs in Baton Rouge, while Frances and Jo argued over an old weather map. The phrase “raft migration” kept coming up in conversation, and, not one to be left in the dark by science geeks, Merl had asked how it worked. 

The idea was simple enough, plants and animals get blown across the sea on floating masses of wood or even buoyant volcanic material. The time frame advanced by Frances’ students implied that the migration had happened around the time of Hurricane Henrietta, but from where?

MaryLiz saw Merl catch her glance. There was only one question in Merl’s eyes. MaryLiz nodded. Yes. Get out. Get out of here, while you can. 

Back in the here and now of the Clarke Bar, Merl raised a silent toast to Bender. Thank you, Cap.

Someone was trying to coax the karaoke machine into operation. Merl’s knew that they would fail, because the bartender, Purvis, kept the electrical safety fuse for the machine safely locked in the bar’s cash drawer.

One of the wallaby trappers from Texas Wildlife Service settled at the bar, glass and phone in hand, with a nod of recognition towards Merl. Neither one of them felt like talking shop. The TWS officer set the glass on the bar top, and resumed flipping through photographs from the day’s efforts. The sounds of ordinary non-marsupial-chasing life washed over them. Merl was almost jealous.

An out of towner tipsied to the bar to ask about the karaoke machine, but quickly became distracted by the wildlife agent’s photos.
 
“What’re those?!”

The TWS agent shrugged. “All in a days work. Wild day, here, check ‘em out. You won’t believe it....”

Merl took a healthy sip of beer, found a quiet spot outside, behind the angled wall of shipping containers that formed the back of the Clarke, and called Cap direct. The phone was still ringing as a crowd gathered around the young wildlife worker and their gallery of cute but impossible photos.

MaryLiz’s phone beeped. It was Merl. Merl was a text only kind of ranch hand. MaryLiz answered.

“Cap’n, Merl. I’m at the Z. I know you wanted to keep things quiet, but the cat’s probably outta the pouch, news wise. Thought you’d wanna know. It wasn’t me.”

MaryLiz took a breath.

“Merl, thanks for calling. This was bound to happen, with so many people involved. Don’t worry about it. If anyone asks you questions, just remember that anything you say is likely to be misreported. Remember where you are. But I can’t think of a single thing you would need to keep a secret. We’ve got cooperation from every agency this side of the Rio Grande. You’re doing a great job. You’re part of the story. Enjoy your night off.”

Merl digested what she’d said. Over the phone, MaryLiz could hear loud music start to play, as if a PA system had been suddenly switched on. An impossibly loud yell of “TESTING” over the PA momentarily blotted out all other sound. Merl sighed. The karaoke machine was now in working order,

Purvis was pocketing a good sized tip, and the Texas Wildlife Service’ most game representative prepared to take the stage.

“Okay, Cap. I’ll keep an eye on things. You know where I am.”

“I sure do. Have a good one, Merl.”
