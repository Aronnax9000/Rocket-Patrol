# Chapter Twenty-Seven: FOXP2

"Our original Mitrochondrial study was just to figure out mother-daughter lineages. You'll remember that we only get our mitochondrial DNA from our mothers, and our wallabies' most recent common n-greats grandmother was born around 1950.

"Wallab-Eve," said Cap.

"Yes you *do* remember. Since we just needed basic geneology, we ran the samples through as fast as we could. We did the same for the Y-Chromosome Adam, we're calling *him* 'Adam-Roo'. We didn't need to completely sequence every single individual genome to establish probable family relationships. So we didn't -- it would have slowed things down. But since you've been gone...." Cass indicated the now massive stack of sample logs next to the sequencer.

"You haven't had the boss looking over your shoulder," said Frances (meaning themself), "so you've been able to do some actual work."

"You betcha we have," said Varley. There was a sparkle in Varley's eye. "Go on, you tell 'em," said Cass. 

"Cass's fed me so much genetic theory that now I almost feel smart," said Varley. "One thing we looked at was FOXP2 genes. FOXP2 is a gene that codes for a kind of protein called Forkhead Box. It's important for brain maturation and the development of speech. Not just in our brains, but in other mammals, mice, and bats for example, and in non mammal species such as birds."

"But those don't talk," said Merl. 

"They do, after a fashion."
