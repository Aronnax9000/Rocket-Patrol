# Chapter Twenty-Seven: FOXP2

"Our original Mitrochondrial study was just to figure out mother-daughter lineages. You'll remember that we only get our mitochondrial DNA from our mothers, and our wallabies' most recent common n-greats grandmother was born around 1950.

"Wallab-Eve," said Cap.

"Yes you *do* remember. Since we just needed basic geneology, we ran the samples through as fast as we could. You don't need to completely sequence a genome to establish probable family relationships. So we didn't -- it would have slowed things down. But since you've been gone."

"You haven't had the boss looking over your shoulder," said Frances (meaning themself), "so you've been able to do some actual work."

"You betcha we have," said Varley. There was a sparkle in Varley's eye. "Go on, you tell 'em," said Cass.

"Cass's fed me so much genetic theory that I almost feel smart," said Varley. "One thing we looked at was FOXP2 genes. FOXP2 is a gene that codes for a kind of protein called Forkhead Box. It's important for brain maturation and the development of speech. Not just in our brains, but in other mammals, mice, for example, and in non mammal species such as birds."
