# Chapter Twenty-Seven: FOXP2

"Our original Mitrochondrial study was just to figure out mother-daughter lineages. You'll remember that we only get our mitochondrial DNA from our mothers, and our wallabies' most recent common n-greats grandmother was born around 1950.

"Wallab-Eve," said Cap.

"Yes you *do* remember. Since we just needed basic geneology, we ran the samples through as fast as we could. Among the males (half the samples, as you'd expect), we did the same for Y-Chromosome Adam -- we're calling *him* 'Adam-Roo'. We didn't need to completely sequence every single individual genome to establish probable family relationships. So we didn't -- it would have slowed things down. But since you've been gone...." Cass indicated the now massive stack of sample logs next to the sequencer.

"You haven't had the boss looking over your shoulder," said Frances (meaning themself), "so you've been able to do some actual work."

"You betcha we have," said Varley. There was a sparkle in Varley's eye. "Go on, you tell 'em," said Cass. 

"Cass's fed me so much genetic theory that now I almost feel smart," said Varley. "One thing we looked at was FOXP2 genes. FOXP2 is a gene that codes for a kind of protein called Forkhead Box. It's important for brain maturation and the development of speech. Not just in our brains, but in other mammals, mice, and bats for example, and in non mammal species such as birds."

"But those don't talk," said Merl. 

"They actually do, after a fashion. Baby mice squeak for their mothers. Boy mice do it twice as often as girl mice. Guess which one has more FOXP2? Bats use echolocation, which is speech of  a sort, and ordinary bird song and mimicry is driven by FOXP2."

Varley, the new expert, chimed in. "Also, the gene does a lot more than just encourage the development of speech. And there's no single gene for any trait. Traits like speech and echolocation result from the interacting effects of a host of different genes. There's also a few different 'flavors' of the Forkhead Box protein. Humans have two that we share, variously, with chimpanzees and bird species. But there's one form of FOXP2 that belongs just to us, and to no other species known to science." The post doc nodded towards Cass the grad student who was, in this case, Varley's superior.

Cass repeated. "No other species known to science.... until *now*."

Merl spoke up. "Here I was thinking I was followin' y'all. What other species? You're not saying the wallabies have *human* DNA?"

Cass blinked, and took a deep breath. "No. I'm saying that at least part of our wallaby population have a variant of FOXP2 that they share with us, and with no other known species, including our closest living ancestors on earth. It's either a chance mutation in the same direction -- unlikely, given that the mutation only occurs in humans among all known naturally evolved species. Or --"

Frances blanched "Or it was engineered into them."

Bender was quizzical. "By the SOVIETS?!"
