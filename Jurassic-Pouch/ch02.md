# Chapter Two: The Poop Talk

Dinner was served in the Mess, and the lights were dimmed. MaryLiz introduced Dr Stapledon to the ranch hands, and yielded the floor to Frances.

“I started noticing the castings while doing wildlife inventory, down in the Rio Grande Valley, a few kilometers south of where we're sitting.”

The first slide appeared on the screen, a collection of dark colored pellets laid in a neat grid along with a ruler to indicate scale. There was a suppressed sigh among a couple of ranchers who considered themselves as familiar with Frances’ ‘Poop Talk’ as anyone needed to be.

“First, I thought it was hare - the animal - or maybe deer, because of the grassy composition. I did moisture analysis, and it’s way too dry to be hare. Then there’s the size distribution. On this plot… [Frances advanced to the next slide] here, you can see the median and the range.

“If it was deer, we’d find adult-sized coprolites, but the only ones found are no bigger than those cast by juvenile deer.

“We deployed fifty wildlife cameras with pretty good coverage of a ten hectare plot, smack dead in the center of what my students are calling Mystery Poop Valley.”

A floorboard creaked as one of the ranchers leaned forwards towards the screen. This part was actually pretty cool, even the fourth time around.

MaryLiz glanced at Jo. The scientist sat motionless on the edge of a chair, fork suspended in mid flight.

“We used a wireless repeater to transmit ten of the cameras' views live. The rest were set to record to  local storage. This is what we saw.”

The screen lit up with a matrix of ten camera views. Trees of a ghostly pale green were visible in most of the scenes, framing a lush river valley, covered in grass. A clock in one corner of the screen ticked off playback time faster than reality: this was time lapse photography.

“It’s all in false color, obviously: none of this is visible light. Nothing much happens until about four in the morning. And then….”

The timecode counters slowed to tick off frames in real time. One of the views, whose motion capture algorithm had triggered first, zoomed to fill the entire screen. Jo heard it before seeing it, a rough scraping against the shell of the camera that had broadcast the stream. Then, blurred inside the near limit of the camera’s depth of field, a finger? And then two, and then, nothing.

A low creature hopped into view of the camera. Like a hare, with powerful haunches. Big as a juvenile deer, but stockier. And no hare, nor deer, stood on two legs like that, not just like that.

The animal turned, and faced back towards the camera. Jo mouthed the word no, but it was an identification any undergrad in Jo’s field would have instantly aced, even with poorer imaging equipment than this. Unmistakable.

The creature loped towards the camera. Jo shrunk backwards involuntarily as the near field characteristics of the lens kicked in, grotesquely distorting the scale of the animal’s outstretched hands.

Suddenly, the view showed only the pre-dawn sky, as the camera, and the stake it was mounted on, were yanked from the soil.

After that, the screen showed only chaotic flashes of undergrowth with a crackling soundtrack as the camera was dragged along the ground. The video ended in a blurred freeze frame of a tuft of grass.

“That’s the camera going out… being dragged out… of the range of our radio repeater.”

The view returned to the composite matrix of the surviving cameras. For a moment, nothing unusual occurred. Then, one by one, each of the remaining live cameras began to meet the same fate. In the field of view of the first two cameras to be snatched, Jo could again see occasional glimpses of the thief. The agile hands, the facial markings, the ever attentive ears…..

Two more cameras disappeared, then three. The final pair lasted a good five minutes longer before meeting the same fate within ten seconds of each other.

Frances raised the room light. The presentation was almost over. It was time to find out if Jo Stapledon was really worth the expenditure of many precious times their weight in liquid hydrogen.

The question hung in the air.

“So,” said Jo. “You’ve got a wallaby.”

“Not a wallaby, several wallabies. The three cameras that were taken at virtually the same time were thirty meters apart. If it was a single individual, it’d have had a maximum of one and a quarter seconds to travel that thirty meters. They’re fast, but not that fast. It’s not just one.”

“Three wallabies,” breathed Jo.

“There’s one more thing. As soon as daylight hit, we drove back out to the valley to see what the other cameras might have recorded, the ones we didn’t have live radio bandwidth for.”

“OK, hit me.”

“We found nothing. That is to say, there were no cameras. The wallabies had discovered and removed all forty of them, without exception and without a trace.”

“And that’s when you called me?”

“Who else should we have called?”

Jo was still gobsmacked. “It’s truly unexpected....”

“Yes, you’re right, it’s truly unexpected!”, exclaimed Frances. “Fifty near-infrared cameras ain’t cheap. If I knew the little buggers were going to take the whole shooting match, I’d have done them the courtesy of leaving a note so they could steal our radio repeater, too.”

“Where’s the radio repeater?” Jo asked.

“It’s on a test bench in the shop,” said Frances.

“No,” said Jo, “I mean, where was it deployed the night you used it to stream the cameras?”

“Oh. I tied it to a tree branch with a cable tie. Along with a fourteen hour external battery. They didn’t take that, either.”

“What kind of tree?”

“I don’t know, a kinda scrubby Texas one. Ask me more questions about Zoology.”

“Is it one that a child could climb?”

“Sure, a motivated one. I climbed it myself a little bit to hang the repeater up there: I wanted good range out of it. Why?”

“OK,” said Jo. “I’m trying to rule out tree kangaroo.”

“Why can’t we rule out every kangaroo? In south Texas? Why are they here? What are they doing?”

It was becoming clear to the ranch hands, that, even with the planet’s greatest experts in the room, the group was out of their collective depth.

It was MaryLiz’s meeting to chair: she’d pulled strings with three different space agencies, a University, and two national governments in order to arrange it.

MaryLiz took in a gentle breath and stretched, breathing out without a sigh: Jo could sense that this was a signal for the room to go quiet, which is what happened.

“Let’s focus on what we know. What are our data sources? The cameras. They’re gone, obviously. But, where did they go? We know the questions we need to answer, but what can we tell from what we already know that we’re not already seeing? And what questions are we not asking?”

This was something to move forward on. Jo turned to Frances.

“I’m gonna wanna see your poop.”

Frances smirked. “I can’t wait to show you. This way, please.”

MaryLiz stopped them. “Frances, wait. You set up my wifi router.”

“In your office, and out in the stable area, sure I did. They’re easy.”

“You set up the repeater for the wildlife cams, too. Can you think of any way we could get a fix on where those cameras all went, from examining the repeater?”

“I already thought about it. Probably not. Most of the cameras didn’t have GPS, and the ones that did weren’t transmitting it in any way that we captured. We knew where we put them, and didn’t think it’d be important.” Frances was not in any way over the stolen cameras. “But, you know I mostly do animals. Ask a real network engineer. I gotta go show Jo my poop.”

“Capiche,” said MaryLiz. “You do you. I know someone we should call. Someone outside the box."

Frances brightened up. “You gonna call Rad?”

“Yep,” said MaryLiz, “I’m gonna call Rad.”

Frances sighed. “Rad.”
