# Chapter Four: Of Niche and Kin

Jo inserted the poop sample into the DNA sequencer, closed the lid, and tapped VACUUM START.

There was an old fashioned thrupping sound as the pump did its work. After a minute a green LED lit. Jo tapped SEQUENCE START.

A solenoid clicked as the sequencer punctured the sample capsule.

“How long will this take?” Frances asked.

“A few hours for PCR and primary sequencing, plus or minus. I wish I could give you a better estimate, but if I could, it’d be because we already know what’s in there.”

“What is in there?”

“Our little pooper is obviously a strict herbivore. We’ll have to wade through a bunch of different plant DNA, which will be a clue to diet. By far the most plentiful DNA is going to be from gut bacteria. That’s useful on its own: gut fauna are species specific. Somewhere in there will be the real prize. Little Pooper’s own DNA sequence.

“Wallaby is something less than a strictly scientific term, so let’s call Little Pooper a ‘macropod’, literally ‘big foot’.

“There’s around 70 known living species of macropod altogether – the wallaby and their kin: kangaroo, wallaroo, and other allies. Many of them are easily ruled out based on what we saw on camera, but I’ll come to that in a minute. Of 70-odd macropod species, about three fifths of them are registered online in GenomeEarth, either in fully or partially sequenced form. I have a post-doc at Pavlovsk Station making some discrete inquiries to see what other species might already be sequenced, but not published.

“If Little Pooper is an escaped lab specimen, we’ll probably get lucky on species ID. There are a relatively limited number of wallaby species favored in captive research, and all of those have long since been sequenced. On the other hand, if it’s a case of a loose exotic pet, it might be a more obscure breed.

A shadow crossed Frances’ face. “I could do with a lot fewer ‘exotic pet owners’ in this world. If these babies escaped from one, it’s irresponsible stewardship. And if they were dumped…. I don’t even want to imagine.”

Jo nodded. “Same in my hemisphere. You said you’re sure that there’s more than one of them, and I’m finding myself in agreement. They might not even be all the same species. I wish I had a daylight photo. What more site context can you give me?”

“I documented eleven sites,” replied the veterinarian, “over two weekends, all in the same ten hectares we set the cameras up in later. Seven sites were used more than once, five of them two weeks in a row. Whether by more than one individual, at any given site, I couldn’t say. It’s all GPS’ed and timestamped, in the poop ‘fridge.” Frances jabbed a thumb towards the white box whirring quietly in the corner, adorned with a “Go Aggies!” refrigerator magnet. “The ones labeled in brown ink have been through freeze-dry.”

Jo joined the genome sequencer onto the ranch’s wifi network, entered ‘macropod’ into the GenomeEarth database search window, and ticked “download all” on the results.

“What’s the local fauna? What lives around south Texas?”

“Well, I’ve mentioned deer and hare, since we know we’re dealing with herbivores. Alligator -- now that I think of it, I’m nominally responsible for giving you the Ranch Safety Briefing. Plenty of other lizards. Wild pigs, bats, marmots, birds, lizards. We’re living at one of the classic crossroads of evolutionary migration here.

Jo nodded. “You did well in focusing on hare and deer. The wallabies are both, in their native lands.”

Frances said, quickly, “You mean convergent evolution.”

“The same. In Australia there’s places you’d mistake for Texas, if you were lobbed there in your sleep. Same terrain and weather, similar plant life. Nature reinvents solutions under similar conditions of life. Kangaroo are our deer – browsers.”

“And we’ve got groundhogs instead of wombats.”

“Precisely.”

Frances stretched. “I could use a nap. Let your analyzer do its thing. In the morning I’ll call out to A&M, see if I can get a couple of starry-eyed undergrads out here to capsule up a few hundred more poop samples for your magic machine. Does that work for you? Or do you need to stay up and nurse your baby?”

“Not since my thesis days. I’ll catch you in the morning. Please ask the Wake-Up Fairy not to knock too early.”
