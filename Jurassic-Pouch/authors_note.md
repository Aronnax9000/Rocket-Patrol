# Author's Note

The world of the Rocket Ranch is set some 80 years into the future (hello, Posterity!) but not pinned to a specific date. 

Many of my favorite science fiction stories ask the reader to permit faster than light travel, infinitely strong materials, positing access to futuristic (and fantastic) technologies that may never be. 

The fastest spacecraft built in my time, would take tens of millennia to reach Proxima Centauri, nearest star to our own. A future breakthrough, may one day take a few zeros off that travel time, but not enough to really matter. Our distant posterity may visit other stars, but we will not. It is less likely that you are reading this in a different solar system than mine, than it is that the English language will survive long enough for you to read it.

We are even limited by the expanse of our own solar system, boldly explored by Lucian, Kepler, Rostand, Verne, Wells, Bradbury, and Clarke. We explore the solar system with robotic probes. But no one is going to walk on Mars any time soon.

What's left to explore? Our own planet, spinning in space for four billion years. Life emerged in splendor here, pretty much as soon as it cooled enough for complex chemistry to take place. We humans arrived less than a thousandth of that time. Our inventions of science and technology, control of fire, the wheel and axle, and the discovery that we stand on only one planet of many vanish "as the dust of one stroke of a nail file" on that scale of time.

This is a story of the exploration of a planetary body, the Earth. In all the Universe, it is the most interesting planet that I know, or have even heard of. This planetary body is filled with wonders that defy our present frontiers. Thank goodness that, as our best thinkers are beavering away in the study and the laboratory, we have our poets to remind us of the possibilities of discovery.

We also leave our footprints we tread upon this Earth. This story is about coming to grips with that, too.

Captain Bender and crew find themselves exploring an exotic alien world, with "splendor beyond compare" (Porco). It just happens to be the planet we, and they, were all born on.

I hope you like it.
