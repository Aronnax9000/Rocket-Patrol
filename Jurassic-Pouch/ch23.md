Dear MaryLiz,

We received and unpacked your LIDAR data set this morning. Dr Groves, emeritus director of the Center, was in to give a coffee talk, and I took the liberty of letting "the Prof" sit in on our first holographic walk through. Dr Groves is a pioneer in digital mapping of karst features, and watched the demonstration with interest. I am of the opinion that I saw Dr Groves silently mouth the word 'Yucatan', but could be mistaken. I can tell you that we did not show the model in its regional context. UNESCO's secret remains safe.

In regards to your enquiry regarding ocean access to the cenote, via air filled cave passages, sea level rise during the period 1960-2050 may indeed have inundated (filled with water) cave passages which were formerly filled with air. 

Those old cave passages may or may not have been large enough to allow human beings to pass through them, even long ago when they were filled with breathable air. But given the size of the cenote, its great diameter, the potential remains for discovery of large cave passages linking the cenote to the Gulf of Mexico.

Attached please find an expanded XYZT file, with your LIDAR data embedded in the USGS model for that segment of the Yucatan Peninsula, the Woods Hole model for the seafloor. The "T" in XYZT stands for "Time", by the way: you can dial up any year you like, and the model will show you the water surface for that year.

Sincerely yours,
Lex
