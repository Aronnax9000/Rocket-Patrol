Subj: Re: yucatan.001.xyz

Dear MaryLiz,

We received and unpacked your LIDAR data set this morning. Dr Groves, emeritus director of the Center, was in to give a coffee talk, and I took the liberty of letting "the Prof" sit in on our first holographic walk through. Dr Groves is a pioneer in digital mapping of karst features, and watched the unveiling of our holo of your map with interest. I am of the opinion that I saw Dr Groves silently mouth the word 'Yucatan', but could be mistaken. We were just showing your model. There was nothing shown that pinned it to Yucatan or anywhere else.

In regards to your enquiry regarding ocean access to the cenote, via air filled cave passages, sea level rise during the period 1960-2050 may indeed have inundated (filled with water) cave passages which were formerly filled with air, during periods in history when the sea level was lower than presently. Please note that the limestones of the Yucatan Peninsula have, altenatively, both risen, and fallen, several times, both during the 400 million year history of the formation of the (coral) bedrock, down to the present time.

Those old cave passages may or may not have been large enough to allow human beings to pass through them, even long ago when they were filled with breathable air. But given the size of the cenote, its great diameter, the potential remains for discovery of large cave passages linking the cenote to the Gulf of Mexico.

Attached please find an expanded XYZT file, with your LIDAR data embedded in the USGS model for that segment of the Yucatan Peninsula, the Woods Hole model for the seafloor. The "T" in XYZT stands for "Time", by the way: you can dial up any year you like, and the model will show you the water surface for that year.

Sincerely yours,
Lex

Bender closed the lid of the laptop. Time to unplug and think.

UNESCO, the "blue helmets" charged with protecting the Earth's natural resources, had been reasonable, but firm. The relict population of wallabies within the Pool of Xblanque were subject to absolute protection by force of international treaties meant to give voice to the voiceless species of planet Earth.  The fact that the wallabies had been purposely bred during the Cold War meant that its location was so sensitive, it was absent from the UNESCO roster, effectively a planetary state secret.

Bender's team's innocence and naivete in visiting the protected cenote was the only way they all could possibly have made it there to collect the precious 3D map of the cenote, now carefully annotated by the WKU team to include the surrounding geology and hydrogeography.

They had jaunted to Yucatan without a thought to publicity.  If they had announced the expedition, aforehand, all of this would have ended on the Merida Quay. Bender sighed.

On the plus side, since their intrusion was innocent UNESCO only demanded forgiveness, since it was far too late to ask permission. Aude et Effice.

It was late at night, and Bender was starting to lose focus. What was planned for tomorrow? There was something... what?

I remember. A day of rest for the whole team. I ordered it myself. 

Bender meditated. What would Neil Armstrong do? Return to basics. What is the core question?

The Wallabies. How did they get inland to the Pool of Xblanque?

From the sea... from the sea....

Bender slept.

Bender awoke at 9 AM. Day of rest. But out in the mess, she could hear coffee cups clinking. And talking. 

It was Frances and Jo, and Merl. It was 9:10 AM. MaryLiz listened as the talk grew louder.

Merl. "They will never let us back there. And we could take care of all of the little poopers." Merl was turning into a wallaby conservationist.
