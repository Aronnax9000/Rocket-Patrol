Dear MaryLiz,

We received and unpacked your LIDAR data set this morning. Dr Groves, emeritus director of the Center, was in to give a coffee talk, and I took the liberty of letting "the Prof" sit in on our first holographic walk through. Dr Groves is a pioneer in digital mapping of karst features, and watched the demonstration with interest. I am of the opinion that I saw Dr Groves silently mouth the word 'Yucatan', but could be mistaken. I can tell you that we did not show the model in its regional context. UNESCO's secret remains safe.

In regards to your enquiry regarding ocean access to the cenote, via air filled cave passages, sea level rise during the period 1960-2050 may indeed have inundated (filled with water) cave passages which were formerly filled with air. 

Those old cave passages may or may not have been large enough to allow human beings to pass through them, even long ago when they were filled with breathable air. But given the size of the cenote, its great diameter, the potential remains for discovery of large cave passages linking the cenote to the Gulf of Mexico.

Attached please find an expanded XYZT file, with your LIDAR data embedded in the USGS model for that segment of the Yucatan Peninsula, the Woods Hole model for the seafloor. The "T" in XYZT stands for "Time", by the way: you can dial up any year you like, and the model will show you the water surface for that year.

Sincerely yours,
Lex

Bender closed the lid of the laptop. Time to unplug and think.

UNESCO, the "blue helmets" charged with protecting the Earth's natural resources, had been reasonable, but firm. The relict population of wallabies within the Pool of Xblanque were subject to absolute protection by force of international treaties forged in the name of the best interests of the voiceless species of planet Earth. 

Bender's team's innocence and naivete in visiting the protecting cenote had, Bender reflected been the only way they all could possibly have made it there to collect the precious digital model of the cenote, now carefully annotated by the WKU team to include the surrounding geology and hydrogeography.

As it was, they had jaunted to Yucatan without a thought to publicity. This was the only reason they had mapped the cenote. Bender was glad that they now only needed to ask UNESCO for forgiveness, not permission. Aude et Effice.

It was late at night, and Bender was starting to lose focus. What was planned for tomorrow? There was something... what?

Bender remembered. A day of rest for the whole team. She's ordered it herself. 

To quiet herself, Bender meditated. What did Neil Armstrong do? Return to basics. What is the scientific question at the heart of the matter?

The Wallabies. How did they get inland to the cenote?

From the sea... from the sea....

Bender slept.

Bender awoke at 9 AM. Day of rest. But out in the mess, she could hear coffee cups clinking. And talking. 

It was Frances and Jo, and
