## The Cavers

To: MaryLiz Bender  
From: Clint Lex, Ph.D. 
Subject: Pool of Xblanque LIDAR model

Dear MaryLiz,

We received and unpacked your LIDAR data set this morning. Dr Groves, was in to give a coffee talk, but the star of the morning colloquium was the holographic walk through of your model, the feature you are calling the Pool of Xblanque. 

Dr Groves is a pioneer in the digital modeling of karst (cave) features. I think I saw Dr Groves silently mouth 'Yucatan', but may be mistaken.

To the question of ocean access to the cenote via air filled cave passages, sea level rise during the period 1960-2050 may indeed have inundated (filled with water) cave passages which were formerly filled with air, during periods in history when the sea level was lower than presently. 

Generally, the limestone of the Yucatàn is far younger than comparable cave bearing rocks in Kentucky, only 65 million years old or younger, and the caves of the Yucatan are, for independent reasons, also far younger than most Kentucky caves. The oldest passages in Yucatàn are around 175,000 years old. Sea levels have been stable in the region for approximately 5,000 years, although climate change has led to slight increases in the modern period.

Those old cave passages may or may not have been large enough to allow human beings to pass through them, even when filled with breathable air. But given the size of the cenote, the potential remains for discovery of large cave passages linking the cenote to the Gulf of Mexico.

Attached please find an expanded XYZT file, with your LIDAR data embedded in the USGS model for that segment of the Yucatan Peninsula, the Woods Hole model for the seafloor. The "T" in XYZT stands for "Time", by the way: you can dial up any year you like, and the model will show you the water surface for that year.

Water-filled caves are among the most dangerous places on this planet to human explorers. Before you enter a cave, please ensure that your team understands the risks of underwater operations in the cave environment.

Sincerely yours,
Lex

Bender closed the lid of the laptop. Time to unplug and think.

UNESCO, the "blue helmets" charged with protecting the Earth's natural resources, had been reasonable, but firm. The relict population of wallabies within the Pool of Xblanque were subject to absolute protection by force of international treaties meant to give voice to the voiceless species of planet Earth.  The fact that the wallabies had been purposely bred during the Cold War meant that its location was so sensitive, it was absent from the UNESCO roster, effectively a planetary state secret.

Bender's team's innocence and naivete in visiting the protected cenote was the only way they all could possibly have made it there to collect the precious 3D map of the cenote, now carefully annotated by the WKU team to include the surrounding geology and hydrogeography.

They had jaunted to Yucatan without a thought to publicity.  If they had announced the expedition, aforehand, all of this would have ended on the Merida Quay. Bender sighed.

On the plus side, since their intrusion was innocent UNESCO only demanded forgiveness, since it was far too late to ask permission. Aude et Effice.

It was late at night, and Bender was starting to lose focus. What was planned for tomorrow? There was something... what?

I remember. A day of rest for the whole team. I ordered it myself. 

Bender meditated. What would Neil Armstrong do? Return to basics. What is the core question?

The Wallabies. How did they get inland to the Pool of Xblanque, so many miles inland from the Gulf?

From the sea... from the sea....

Bender slept.

Bender awoke at 9 AM to the aroma of fresh coffee. A day of rest? Out in the mess, the crew was stirring. And trying to let Bender sleep in, unsuccessfully.  MaryLiz listened as the whispers grew louder.

Merl. "They'll never let us back there."

MaryLiz said, we might not need them to.
