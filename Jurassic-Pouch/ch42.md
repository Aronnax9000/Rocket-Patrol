# Beneath the ISS

The South Pacific Garbage Patch had long been cleaned up, but the Tomb of the Satellites would have to wait a few centuries more, or a billion years, depending on the breaks.

Kessler's syndrome was proposed in the late 20th century, as commercial and military satellite launches -- and launch failures -- quickly populated the skies with space debris of human making. At differential speeds of 17 thousand miles an hour, a fleck of paint with no more mass than that removed by a manicuriust could damage a billion dollars worth of hardware... or end human lives.

Finally, project XXXXX used space lasers to de-orbit the whole lot.

They landed it all in the southern Indian Ocean now called the Antartic Ocean, and they did it with such precision as to lay a perfect Titanic style streak of space garbage across the bottom of a sea floor chosen by definition as the oceanic pole of inaccessibility.

The remains of a 1960s Soviet Satellite lie somewhere, among all that wreckage. Can Bender and her crew find the secret, before it is too late?
