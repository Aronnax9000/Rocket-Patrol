## Clarke Bar

The hippest beach bar in Sustainaville, presided over by Purvis the bartender. Inspired by the White Hart in Arthur C. Clarke's short story anthology "Tales from the White Hart", and its protagonist. A place where honeymooning tourists rub elbows with the locals.

## Sustainaville

Built on South Padre Island, by surfers and aerospace engineers. The core of what is now known as Old Sustainaville consisted of conventional 20th century houses and trailer homes, augmented by a unified structure made of recycled rocket stages, and retired experimental habitation modules, an International Space Station on Earth. 

Most of Old Sustainaville was destroyed by Henrietta, the planet's first Category 6 hurricane. The surviving structure was swept out to sea along with the residents who failed to evacuate, including Bender ("SLAM!"). 

After Hurricane Henrietta, the survivors and returning residents built New Sustainaville, fortified against the elements. Hopefully.

## Yucatan
