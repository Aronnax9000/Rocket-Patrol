# Rocket Patrol Project
## Contributor License Agreement

The “Rocket Patrol” project is a community-driven collaboration with the goal of developing a fictional universe of discourse. The collective output of the project may be any type of activity or product, and we want to encourage the broadest possible distribution with the least restrictions. That way, anyone can use what we create and build upon it as well as distribute it without worrying about “ownership”.

To that end, anyone contributing to the project agrees that any output will automatically be released to the world with a [Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

This means that anyone is free to distribute the output or make a derivative work (e.g. a remix, mashup, sequels, etc.). They could even do so commercially (e.g. they could sell books, t-shirts, stickers, movie rights, etc.). The only restriction is that they must credit this group as the original creator in some way (e.g. within a book’s acknowledgements, credits of a movie, attribution in a product description, etc.).

Given that this group is a collective (and the name of the project itself may change over time), it’s helpful to identify a more permanent entity that can be referenced as the creator. In that light, all contributions to the “Rocket Patrol” project are considered to be granted to “Cosmic Perspective LLC”. As such, they will be the official grantor of the CC BY 4.0 license on all collective output.

An example declaration in a distributed work would be something like:

> “This work is based upon characters and situations developed by Cosmic Perspective
LLC released under Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0) license.”

For clarity, the type of output covered in the license includes writing (e.g. complete stories, plot outlines, character descriptions, etc.), static visual arts (e.g. drawings, diagrams, paintings, etc.), and dynamic audio/visual arts (e.g. video, film, animation, podcasts, performances, etc.), etc.

Basically, anything that could typically be covered by copyright protection.

NOTE: When contributing to the discussions in any form, collaborators are required to
announce in an appropriate fashion (e.g. in writing in an email or electronic chat, verbally in person or teleconference, visually in a graphical work, etc.) when a contribution cannot be included in the collective output. Otherwise, the output may become tainted by rights held by others which are not compatible with a Creative Commons license.
